# Eye-movement
developed an eye using JavaScript and CSS which follows the mouse cursor around the screen

load the code like seen on the screen and you should see an eye appear the pupil should follow your mouse cursur accross the screen.

in the future Id like to develop a way for the eye to blink when you click the mouse
